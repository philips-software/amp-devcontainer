**amp-devcontainer *SHALL* be able to compile valid source-code into a working executable targeting the container host architecture**

Compiling valid source-code into working executables, able to run inside the container, can be necessary in several scenarios e.g.
- When running tests inside the container
- When building plug-ins, extensions, code generators, or other additional tools that need to run inside the container
