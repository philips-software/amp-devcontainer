# Compilation cache

**amp-devcontainer *SHALL* be able to cache the results of a compilation to speed-up subsequent compilations**

Maintaining a compilation cache can be useful in both local- and ci development scenarios.
A compilation cache can provide benefits like
- Reduce developer waiting time and context switches
- Reduce CPU usage at the cost of more disk usage, potentially reducing energy consumption and cost for metered ci-systems
