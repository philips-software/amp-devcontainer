            ## Description

            This issue is automatically created as a gentle reminder to evaluate the tool versions, and base container, for
            the container image built from this repository. The checklist below describes the steps that should be taken,
            and checked-off before this issue can be closed. Any decisions about purposefully not updating a tool to a newer
            version should be logged as issue comment. The general philosophy is to always include the latest tool versions
            and the latest [LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) version of Ubuntu.

            Please note that, where possible, tool versions are kept up to date by Dependabot. Below list includes tools that
            are not under Dependabot control.
