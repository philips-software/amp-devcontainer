            ## Description

            This issue is automatically created as a gentle reminder to evaluate and update the tool versions for the container images built from this repository.
            The checklist below describes the steps that should be taken, and checked-off before this issue can be closed.
            Any decisions about purposefully not updating a tool to a newer version should be logged as issue comment.
            The general philosophy is to always include the latest tool versions and the latest [LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) version of Ubuntu.

            Please note that, where possible, tool versions are kept up to date by Dependabot.
            Below list includes tools that are not under Dependabot control.
