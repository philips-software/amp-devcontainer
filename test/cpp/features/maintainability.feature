Feature: Maintainability

  As a software craftsperson,
  to ensure that I have access to a stable and reliable development environment,
  I want my development environment to be maintainable over time.

  Rule: Tool and dependency updates
    amp-devcontainer *SHOULD* contain up-to-date tools and dependencies.

    Keeping tools and dependencies up-to-date helps ensure that the development environment remains secure, stable, and compatible with the latest technologies.
    It also helps prevent issues related to deprecated or unsupported software versions, reducing maintenance overhead and improving overall developer productivity.
    Regular updates can also introduce new features and improvements that enhance the development experience.

  Rule: Automatic updates
    amp-devcontainer *SHOULD* provide support for automatic updates when consumed as a dependency.

    Providing support for automatic updates when amp-devcontainer is consumed as a dependency helps ensure that users always have access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
    This reduces the maintenance burden on users, as they do not need to manually track and apply updates.
    Automatic updates can also help ensure compatibility with other dependencies and tools, improving the overall stability and reliability of the development environment.

  Rule: Architectural decisions
    amp-devcontainer *SHOULD* document its architectural decisions.

    Documenting architectural decisions helps provide context and rationale for the design choices made in the development environment.
    This information can be valuable for future maintainers, as it helps them understand the reasoning behind certain implementations and can guide them in making informed decisions when modifying or extending the environment.
    Clear documentation of architectural decisions can also facilitate collaboration among team members and improve overall maintainability.

  Rule: Container image size
    amp-devcontainer *SHOULD* aim to keep its container image size as small as possible without compromising functionality.

    Keeping the container image size small helps improve performance, reduce resource consumption, and minimize the time required to download and deploy the development environment.
    A smaller image size can also help reduce storage costs and improve scalability, particularly in cloud-based environments.
    By optimizing the container image size, amp-devcontainer can provide a more efficient and user-friendly experience for developers.

    <acceptance-criteria>
    - The container image size is monitored.
    - The compressed image size is kept below 1 GiB.
    </acceptance-criteria>
